Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. We need data structures in computer science and programming for two main reasons, like
   organization and efficient access. Data structures help us organize and manage data in a
   structured way. They provide a way to store, manipulate, and retrieve data effectively.


What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
